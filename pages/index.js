          <strong><em>Why did you take up IT?</em></strong><br></br><br></br>
          - I chose IT as a course due to my childhood interest in playing games, which sparked my
          curiosity about technology. I have always been intrigued by how systems operate, and
          that inspiration led me to enroll in BSIT.

        <p>
          <strong><em>What career do you see yourself exploring after graduation?</em></strong><br></br><br></br>
          - In the near future, I see myself exploring more subjects related to my field, such as data
          analytics and cybersecurity, while still pursuing a career as a web developer.
        </p><br></br><hr></hr>

        <p>
          <strong><em>What do you expect to learn in this subject?</em></strong><br></br><br></br>
          - I hope to learn more about different programming languages and, ideally, develop the
          skills and creativity needed to create my own usable systems without relying on
          guidelines.
        </p><br></br><hr></hr>

        <p>
          <strong><em>What topics you want to be discussed in this subject?</em></strong><br></br><br></br>
          - In our subject on System Integration and Architecture, I would like to cover topics such
          as API design and management, exploration of data integration techniques and data
          warehousing.
